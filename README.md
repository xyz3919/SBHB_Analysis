# Project - Supermassive Black Hole Binary Finder

## Introduction

The goal of this code is to search for the peioridc quasar candidates using the light curves from Dark Energy Survey (DES), Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), and other archival imaging surveys. 

## Before running any analysis

### setup PATH and PYTHONPATH

Need to run them first everytime, when you want to run the script in a new terminal. 
If you don't want to setup the path evrytime. You can replace the `pwd` with absolute path and put those two lines into your ~/.bashrc.
```
export PATH=$PATH:`pwd`/bin
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:`pwd`/python
```

### Install eups 

In order to connect to DES database, we need to install eups([manual link](https://opensource.ncsa.illinois.edu/confluence/display/DESDM/EUPS+User%27s+Guide)), which is a DESDM's new package management system.
You might need a password for svn.
```
install_eups.sh
```

Follow the instruction and you can choose to intall eups at any path you want.

### Setup some eups packages

Need to execute this command before running the scripts in a new terminal.
For despydb, you need ~/.desservice.ini in order to connect to DES database.
```
source setup.sourceme
```
You can set up more packages, but don't forget to install them first("eups distrib install $package $version") and put "setup $packgename" into setup.sourceme .

## Generate the quasar catalog 

### Download raw quasar catalogs.

Go to your workspace or where you want to store you data and do the analysis.
```
download_raw_catalog.sh
```
This will download 1. million quasar catalog, 2. OzDES catalog(No longer used, we query DR1 directely), 3. SDSS DR7 quasar catalog and 4. SDSS DR14 quasar catalog.

### Process catalog

```
generate_quasar_catalog
```
The catalogs are in the "catalog/".
"DR14+DR7+OzDES+Milliq.txt" includes all the spectroscopically confirmed quasars in 10 DES-SN fields.
"DR14+DR7+OzDES+Milliq_S1S2.txt" includes all spectroscopically confirmed quasars in S1 and S2.

## Generate quasar light curves

Once we have the quasar catalog, we then need to make the optical light curves from DES and SDSS.
```
generate_lightcurves
```
This program will query DES and SDSS strip 82 database and download the single-epoch information. 
We also correct the magnitude difference due to different telescope systems.(tiny but important, SDSS-> DES).

```
lightcurve_stat
```
This program will tell us how many quasar has enough imaging epochs and some of thier properties like magnitude and number of epochs.
It will also generate the file "lightcurves/lc_clean.csv", which will be used as final quasar catalog for the light curve analysis.

## Analyzing the light curves
Before you run the analyzing program, make sure run the program in background. (Take looooong time!, ~3days x 45-core )
you should understand how many cores your server has.
```
nohup lightcurve_analysis >> log_pring &
```
You can check "log_period_analysis" to see how many jobs are finished.

## Find strong candidates
```
periodogram_stat
```
Check "statistics/strong_candidates.csv" to see the strong candidates.

## Autocorrelation function (ACF)

We use the z-transformed discrete correlation function (ZCDF) code to perform ACF ([The website](https://webhome.weizmann.ac.il/home/tal/zdcf2.html)).
